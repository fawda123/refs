abstract = {Maintaining proper freshwater and marine inputs is essential for estuarine function. Alteration of freshwater flows into small tributaries that traverse the upland- estuarine margin may be especially problematic, e.g., by impacting the nursery areas for juvenile finfish and shellfish. We used stomach contents and stable isotope analysis ($\delta$13C, $\delta$15N) to examine effects of freshwater flow alterations on the trophic ecology of juvenile common snook (Centropomus undecimalis) in four mangrove creeks with different freshwater flow regimes. Diet diversity in less degraded creeks was greater than in more degraded creeks, and the importance (by {\%} mass) of the top three preys was disproportionately higher in the more degraded creeks. Stable isotope measures of trophic diversity corroborate these trends, suggesting higher intraspecific trophic diversity in less degraded creeks. The difference in diet diversity of juvenile snook may be an indicator of an overall change in ecosystem function and these shifts in food web structure may affect the rate that juveniles of this and other species with similar habitat requirements successfully join the adult population.},

abstract = {Land-use change in the coastal zone has led to worldwide degradation of marine coastal ecosystems and a loss of the goods and services they provide. Restoration is the process of assisting the recovery of an ecosystem that has been degraded, damaged, or destroyed and is critical for habitats where natural recovery is hindered. Uncertainties about restoration cost and feasibility can impede decisions on whether, what, how, where, and how much to restore. Here, we perform a synthesis of 235 studies with 954 observations from restoration or rehabilitation projects of coral reefs, seagrass, mangroves, saltmarshes and oyster reefs worldwide, and evaluate cost, survival of restored organisms, project duration, area, and techniques applied. Findings showed that while the median and average reported costs for restoration of one hectare of marine coastal habitat were around 80,000 US{\$} (2010) and 1,600,000 US{\$} (2010) respectively, the real total costs (median) are likely to be 2-4 times higher.

abstract = {The Deepwater Horizon oil spill constituted an ecosystem-level injury in the northern Gulf of Mexico. Much oil spread at 1100–1300 m depth, contaminating and affecting deepwater habitats. Factors such as oil-biodegradation, ocean currents and response measures (dispersants, burning) reduced coastal oiling. Still, {\textgreater} 2100 km of shoreline and many coastal habitats were affected. Research demonstrates that oiling caused a wide range of biological effects, although worst-case impact scenarios did not materialize. Biomarkers in individual organisms were more informative about oiling stress than population and community indices. Salt marshes and seabird populations were hard hit, but were also quite resilient to oiling effects. Monitoring demonstrated little contamination of seafood. Certain impacts are still understudied, such as effects on seagrass communities. Concerns of long-term impacts remain for large fish species, deep-sea corals, sea turtles and cetaceans. These species and their habitats should continue to receive attention (monitoring and research) for years to come.},

abstract = {Increasingly on a worldwide scale, legislation has been adopted to determine the ecological integrity of surface waters including streams, rivers, lakes, estuaries and coastal waters. An integral part of determining ecological integrity is the measurement of biological integrity, typically emphasizing analyses of plankton, benthos, macroalgae and fish. In the development of protocols for evaluating biological integrity, benthic macroinvertebrate communities are the most consistently emphasized biotic component of aquatic ecosystems. A plethora of methodologies with hundreds of indices, metrics and evaluation tools are presently available. An ecologically parsimonious approach dictates that investigators should place greater emphasis on evaluating the suitability of indices that already exist prior to developing new ones. Hence, the authors organized within the American Society of Limnology and Oceanography 2006 Summer Meeting, 4-9 June 2006, in Victoria, BC, Canada, a special session with the objective to compare methodologies, applications and interpretations existing in various countries and attempting to contribute to an improved understanding of the suitability of such approaches when using benthic communities. From the 25 contributions presented in this session, eight manuscripts were selected to be included in this special issue of Ecological Indicators including new index development, novel validation approaches, assessment of spatio-temporal applications, interpretations relative to management needs and potential adaptive management modifications to maximize the robustness, sensitivity, and representativeness of environmental information conveyed to management. {\textcopyright} 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {Using a long-term (1995–2014) monitoring network, from 51 sampling stations in estuaries and coasts of the Basque Country (Bay of Biscay), the objective of this investigation was to assess the responsiveness of 83 variables in water (18), sediments (27), biota (26), phytoplankton (2), macroinvertebrates (5) and fishes (5) to different human pressures and management actions. We used a total of 3247 series of data to analyse trends of improvement and worsening in quality. In a high percentage of the cases, the management actions taken have resulted in positive effects in the environment, as shown by the trend analysis in this investigation. Overall, much more trends of improvement than of worsening have been observed; this is true for almost all the media and biological components studied, with the exception of phytoplankton; and it applies as well to almost all the stations and water bodies, with the exception of those corresponding to areas with water treatment pending of accomplishment. In estuaries with decreasing human pressures during the period, the percentage of series showing quality improvement was higher (approx. 30{\%}) than those showing worsening of quality (12{\%}). Moreover, in those water bodies showing an increase of pressure, variables which can be considered indicators of anthropogenic effects showed negative trends (quality worsening). On the other hand, some of the variables analysed were more affected by natural variability than by changes in pressures. That was the case of silicate, nitrate and suspended solids, which followed trends correlated to salinity, which, in turn, was related to the rainfall regime during the study period.},

abstract = {Restoration and rehabilitation* of existing or former mangrove forest areas is extremely important today. In fact, given the importance of mangrove forest ecosystems, and the current threat to these coastal forests, this is an imperative. But actual planting of mangroves is rarely needed as mangroves annually produce hundreds or thousands of seeds or seedlings per tree, which under the proper hydrologic conditions can recolonize former mangrove areas (returned to normal hydrology) very rapidly. There are many different techniques and methods utilized in restoring mangroves. Because some of these have resulted in identifiable successes or failures, we wish to present herein a summary description of several preferred methods for planning and implementing mangrove rehabilitation. In summary, five critical steps are necessary to achieve successful mangrove restoration: 1. Understand the autecology (individual species ecology) of the mangrove species at the site; in particular the patterns of reproduction, propagule distribution, and successful seedling establishment. 2. Understand the normal hydrologic patterns that control the distribution and successful establishment and growth of targeted mangrove species. 3. Assess modifications of the original mangrove environment that currently prevent natural secondary succession (recovery after damage). 4. Design the restoration program to restore appropriate hydrology and, if possible, utilize natural volunteer mangrove propagule recruitment for plant establishment. 5. Only utilize actual planting of propagules, collected seedlings, or cultivated seedlings after determining (through steps a-d) that natural recruitment will not provide the quantity of successfully established seedlings, rate of stabilization, or rate of growth of saplings established as objectives for the restoration project (Lewis and Marshall 1997).},

abstract = {Ecosystem services (ES) modeling studies typically use a forecasting approach to predict scenarios of future ES provision. Usually, these forecasts do not inform on how specific policy alternatives will influence future ES supply and whether this supply can match ES demand - important information for policy-makers in practice. Addressing these gaps, we present a multi-method backcasting approach that links normative visions with explorative land-use and ES modeling to infer land-use policy strategies for matching regional ES supply and demand. Applied to a case study, the approach develops and evaluates a variety of ES transition pathways and identifies types, combinations and timings of policy interventions that increase ES benefits. By making explicit ES sensitivity towards regional policy strategies and global boundary conditions over time, the approach allows to address key uncertainties involved in ES modeling studies.},

abstract = {The research objective was to adapt the ultraviolet (UV)photolysis method to determine dissolved organic nitrogen (DON) in aqueous extracts of aerosol samples. DON was assumed to be the difference in total concentration of inorganic nitrogen forms before and after sample irradiation. Using a 2 2 factorial design the authors found that the optimal conversion of urea, amino acids (alanine, aspartic acid, glycine, and serine), and methylamine for a reactor temperature of 44 °C occurred at pH 2.0 with a 24-hr irradiance period at concentrations {\textless} µM of organic nitrogen. Different decomposition mechanisms were evident: the photolysis of amino acids and methylamine released mainly ammonium (NH 4 + ), but urea released a near equimolar ratio of NH 4 + and nitrate (NO 3 − ). The method was applied to measure DON in the extracts of aerosol samples from Tampa, FL, over a 32-day sampling period. Average dissolved inorganic (DIN) and DON concentrations in the particulate matter fraction PM 10 were 78.1 ± 29.2 nmol-Nm −3 and 8.3 ± 4.9 nmol-Nm −3 , respectively. The ratio between DON and total dissolved nitrogen ([TDN] = DIN + DON) was 10.1 ± 5.7{\%}, and the majority of the DON (79.1 ± 18.2{\%}) was found in the fine particulate matter (PM 2.5 ) fraction. The average concentrations of DIN and DON in the PM 2.5 fraction were 54.4 ± 25.6 nmol-Nm −3 and 6.5 ± 4.4 nmol-Nm −3 , respectively. {\textcopyright} 2006 Air and Waste Management Association.},

Participants identified and classified the Gulf habitat types based on CMECS, linked ecosystem services to habitat types, and prioritized services using expert opinion. Only three categories of ecosystem services were considered: regulating, provisioning, and cultural. However, supporting services, such as biological interactions, were considered as part of reclassified services. Highly ranked services were distributed across all the three service categories for each Gulf habitat, except for mangroves and dune/beach (only regulating and cultural services). Predictably, the majority of the habitat types were linked to the service of food. The importance of this exercise lies in the utility of the results for r...},

abstract = {Quantitative studies that assess and map the relationship between the supply and social demand of ecosystem services are scarce. Here we address both supply and social demand sides by spatially analyzing ecosystem service trade-offs from three value-dimensions - i.e., biophysical, socio-cultural and economic, and across different landscape units in southeast Spain. To accomplish this goal, within different landscape units, we quantify the supply side by mapping the biophysical values of five ecosystem services, and the social demand exploring their socio-cultural and economic values by analyzing social preferences and contingent valuation methods, respectively. Our results show that the assessments of ecosystem services using different value-dimensions are complementary and useful for (1) identifying ecosystem service trade-offs, both on the supply- and on the social demand-side, and (2) analyzing spatial mismatches among the three value-dimensions of ecosystem services. We also believe that our approach facilitates the exploration of ecosystem services trade-offs on a spatial landscape scale, and results can be used by managers to identify areas in which services are declining or priority areas for conservation based on maximizing ecosystem services, and will be useful in detecting potential conflicts associated with new management and planning practices.},

abstract = {Regional warming associated with climate change is linked with altered range and abundance of species and ecosystems worldwide. However, the ecological impacts of changes in the frequency of extreme events have not been as well documented, especially for coastal and marine environments. We used 28 y of satellite imagery to demonstrate that the area of mangrove forests has doubled at the northern end of their historic range on the east coast of Florida. This expansion is associated with a reduction in the frequency of "extreme" cold events (days colder than -4 °C), but uncorrelated with changes in mean annual temperature, mean annual precipitation, and land use. Our analyses provide evidence for a threshold response, with declining frequency of severe cold winter events allowing for poleward expansion of mangroves. Future warming may result in increases in mangrove cover beyond current latitudinal limits of mangrove forests, thereby altering the structure and function of these important coastal ecosystems.},

abstract = {Time series of environmental measurements are essential for detecting, measuring and understanding changes in the Earth system and its biological communities. Observational series have accumulated over the past 2-5 decades from measurements across the world's estuaries, bays, lagoons, inland seas and shelf waters influenced by runoff. We synthesize information contained in these time series to develop a global view of changes occurring in marine systems influenced by connectivity to land. Our review is organized around four themes: (i) human activities as drivers of change; (ii) variability of the climate system as a driver of change; (iii) successes, disappointments and challenges of managing change at the sea-land interface; and (iv) discoveries made from observations over time. Multidecadal time series reveal that many of the world's estuarine-coastal ecosystems are in a continuing state of change, and the pace of change is faster than we could have imagined a decade ago. Some have been transformed into novel ecosystems with habitats, biogeochemistry and biological communities outside the natural range of variability. Change takes many forms including linear and nonlinear trends, abrupt state changes and oscillations. The challenge of managing change is daunting in the coastal zone where diverse human pressures are concentrated and intersect with different responses to climate variability over land and over ocean basins. The pace of change in estuarine-coastal ecosystems will likely accelerate as the human population and economies continue to grow and as global climate change accelerates. Wise stewardship of the resources upon which we depend is critically dependent upon a continuing flow of information from observations to measure, understand and anticipate future changes along the world's coastlines.},

abstract = {The increasing anthropogenic pressure on natural environments results in impacts that affect tropical forest areas and their biodiversity [1, 2]. Adverse impacts on terrestrial and oceanic environments often compound in the intertidal area, where mangrove forest ecosystems thrive. In tropical coastal areas of many developing countries where people depend on wood and other mangrove forest products and services, forest degradation leads to socioeconomic problems. At the same time, increasing freshwater needs in these areas are expected to cause additional problems [3-5]. On the basis of remote sensing and ground truthing complemented by colonial archival material from the Dutch East India Company (1602-1800), we report that changes to the historic system of inland freshwater management have increased dramatically in recent times. Hydrological changes, such as interbasin transfers, have resulted in a qualitative ecological and socioeconomic degradation in three coastal lagoons in southern Sri Lanka. Variations in river hydrology have caused changes in the areas suitable as mangrove habitat and, thus, have resulted in an altered distribution. However, increases in mangrove area can mask the degradation of the site in terms of floristic composition, significance of the species, and biodiversity (this effect is termed "cryptic ecological degradation"). It is important that such changes be carefully monitored to ensure biological and socioeconomic sustainability. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd All rights reserved.},

abstract = {Coastal ecosystem management typically relies on subjective interpretation of scientific understanding, with limited methods for explicitly incorporating process knowledge into decisions that must meet multiple, potentially competing stakeholder objectives. Conversely, the scientific community lacks methods for identifying which advancements in system understanding would have the highest value to decision-makers. A case in point is barrier island restoration, where decision-makers lack tools to objectively use system understanding to determine how to optimally use limited contingency funds when project construction in this dynamic environment does not proceed as expected. In this study, collaborative structured decision-making (SDM) was evaluated as an approach to incorporate process understanding into mid-construction decisions and to identify priority gaps in knowledge from a management perspective. The focus was a barrier island restoration project at Ship Island, Mississippi, where sand will be used to close an extensive breach that currently divides the island. SDM was used to estimate damage that may occur during construction, and guide repair decisions within the confines of limited availability of sand and funding to minimize adverse impacts to project objectives. Sand was identified as more limiting than funds, and unrepaired major breaching would negatively impact objectives. Repairing minor damage immediately was determined to be generally more cost effective (depending on the longshore extent) than risking more damage to a weakened project. Key gaps in process-understanding relative to project management were identified as the relationship of island width to breach formation; the amounts of sand lost during breaching, lowering, or narrowing of the berm; the potential for minor breaches to self-heal versus developing into a major breach; and the relationship between upstream nourishment and resiliency of the berm to storms. This application is a prototype for using structured decision-making in support of engineering projects in dynamic environments where mid-construction decisions may arise; highlights uncertainty about barrier island physical processes that limit the ability to make robust decisions; and demonstrates the potential for direct incorporation of process-based models in a formal adaptive management decision framework.},

abstract = {A coupled ecosystem modeling approach was used to evaluate how select combinations of large-scale river diversions in the lower Mississippi River Deltaic Plain may affect the distribution, biomass, and landings of fish and shellfish over decades relative to a future without action. These river diversions are controlled openings in the riverbank of the Mississippi River designed to reintroduce sediment, water, and nutrients into hydrologically isolated coastal wetlands in order to mitigate wetland loss. We developed a spatial ecosystem model using Ecopath with Ecosim (EwE) software, and prepared it to receive output from a Delft3D hydrodynamic model coupled to primary production models. The Delft3D model provided environmental drivers including salinity, temperature, Chl a, total suspended solids, and change in wetland cover as a result of simulated river diversions over decadal model runs. Driver output was averaged either daily, monthly, or annually depending on the parameter. A novel oyster-specific subroutine is introduced in this paper to incorporate information at daily intervals in Ecospace, while Ecospace runs on a monthly time step. The ecosystem model simulates biomass and distribution of fish and shellfish species, and landings of targeted fisheries species, as a result of environmental changes projected for a preliminary set of management scenarios designed to evaluate and screen select combinations of river diversions. Abundant local field samples and landings data allowed for model calibration and validation. The results of simulations indicate that inflow of Mississippi River water in estuaries may cause local shifts in species assemblages. These changes were in some cases direct effects of decreased salinity, such as locally reduced Spotted Seatrout biomass. Changes in some other species in the affected areas resulted from indirect effects; for example, reduced Chl a (as a result of increased TSS) resulted in near-field reductions of Gulf Menhaden. The simulations also showed that local biomass reductions were mostly the result of redistribution, since the scenario with the proposed diversions open had minimal impact on the total biomass or landings of species simulated in the Mississippi River Delta as compared to a future without action. The model and its output were used as a decision support tool to help evaluate and compare alternative management actions. The results of this study played a role in the decision by the Coastal Protection and Restoration Authority to prioritize moving forward to conduct more detailed analyses through engineering and design of the two middle diversions but not the two lower diversions that were tested in this study.},

abstract = {This study adapts and applies the evidence-based approach for causal inference, a medical standard, to the restoration and sustainable management of large-scale aquatic ecosystems. Despite long-term investments in restoring aquatic ecosystems, it has proven difficult to adequately synthesize and evaluate program outcomes, and no standard method has been adopted. Complex linkages between restorative actions and ecosystem responses at a landscape scale make evaluations problematic and most programs focus on monitoring and analysis. Herein, we demonstrate a new transdisciplinary approach integrating techniques from evidence-based medicine, critical thinking, and cumulative effects assessment. Tiered hypotheses about the effects of landscape-scale restorative actions are identified using an ecosystem conceptual model. The systematic literature review, a health sciences standard since the 1960s, becomes just one of seven lines of evidence assessed collectively, using critical thinking strategies, causal criteria, and cumulative effects categories. As a demonstration, we analyzed data from 166 locations on the Columbia River and estuary representing 12 indicators of habitat and fish response to floodplain restoration actions intended to benefit culturally and economically important, threatened and endangered salmon. Synthesis of the lines of evidence demonstrated that hydrologic reconnection promoted macrodetritis export, prey availability, and juvenile fish access and feeding. Upon evaluation, the evidence was sufficient to infer cross-boundary, indirect, compounding, and delayed cumulative effects, and suggestive of nonlinear, landscape-scale, and spatial density effects. Therefore, on the basis of causal inferences regarding foodweb functions, we concluded that the restoration program is having a cumulative beneficial effect on juvenile salmon. The lines of evidence developed are transferable to other ecosystems: modeling of cumulative net ecosystem improvement, physical modeling of ecosystem controlling factors, meta-analysis of restoration action effectiveness, analysis of data on target species, research on critical ecological uncertainties, evidence-based review of the literature, and change analysis on the landscape setting. As with medicine, the science of ecological restoration needs scientific approaches to management decisions, particularly because the consequences affect species extinctions and the availability of ecosystem services. This evidencebased approach will enable restoration in complex coastal, riverine, and tidal-fluvial ecosystems like the lower Columbia River to be evaluated when data have accumulated without sufficient synthesis.},

abstract = {Abstract Bayesian inference is an important statistical tool that is increasingly being used by ecologists. In a Bayesian analysis, information available before a study is conducted is summarized in a quantitative model or hypothesis: the prior probability distribution. Bayes' Theorem uses the prior probability distribution and the likelihood of the data to generate a posterior probability distribution. Posterior probability distributions are an epistemological alternative to P-values and provide a direct measure of the degree of belief that can be placed on models, hypotheses, or parameter estimates. Moreover, Bayesian information-theoretic methods provide robust measures of the probability of alternative models, and multiple models can be averaged into a single model that reflects uncertainty in model construction and selection. These methods are demonstrated through a simple worked example. Ecologists are using Bayesian inference in studies that range from predicting single-species population dynamics to understanding ecosystem processes. Not all ecologists, however, appreciate the philosophical underpinnings of Bayesian inference. In particular, Bayesians and frequentists differ in their definition of probability and in their treatment of model parameters as random variables or estimates of true values. These assumptions must be addressed explicitly before deciding whether or not to use Bayesian methods to analyse ecological data.},

abstract = {In the 21st century, accelerated sea- level rise and continued coastal development are expected to greatly alter coastal landscapes across the globe. Historically, many coastal ecosystems have responded to sea- level fluctu- ations via horizontal and vertical movement on the landscape. However, anthropogenic activities, including urbanization and the construction of flood- prevention infrastructure, can produce barriers that impede ecosystem migration. Here we show where tidal saline wetlands have the potential to migrate landward along the northern Gulf of Mexico coast, one of the most sea- level rise sensitive and wetland- rich regions of the world. Our findings can be used to identify migration corridors and develop sea- level rise adaptation strategies to help ensure the continued availability of wetland- associated ecosystem goods and services.},

abstract = {We evaluated long-term surface water nitrate and atmospheric nitrogen (N) deposition trends for a group of nine predominantly forested Appalachian Mountain watersheds during a recent multidecadal period (1986–2009) in which regional NOx emissions have been progressively reduced. Statistical analysis showed unexpected linear declines in both annual surface water nitrate-N concentrations (mean =46.4{\%}) and yields (mean =47.7{\%}) among the watersheds corresponding to comparable declines in annual wet N deposition (mean =34.4{\%}) resulting from U.S. NOx emission control programs during the same time period. Nitrate-N concentration trends were robust across a large geographical region and appeared insensitive to watershed size across several orders of magnitude—suggesting that the improvements in water quality are probably propagated to surface and estuarine waters downstream. Surface waters are thus responding to declining atmospheric N deposition in much the same way they responded to declining sulfur deposition—although only one watershed showed a 1:1 relationship. Application of a kinetic N saturation model indicated that all nine forested watersheds are exhibiting signs of N saturation as evidenced by a limited, but variable, efficiency of demand for N. Further reductions in N deposition would be expected to produce additional reductions in streamwater N loads.},

abstract = {Despite several thousand publications concerning mangrove forests, a clear understanding of the dynamics in mangrove ecosystems is just beginning to emerge. Of the several hypotheses advanced to account for species zonation, several warrant further attention, but others should be laid to rest. In particular, hypotheses concerning zonation as plant succession and the tidal sorting of propagules clearly are not supported by the available data. Geomorphological factors establish much, but not all, of the framework within which mangrove forests develop. Climatic factors, particularly rainfall, are important determinants of species richness, stand structure, and growth dynamics in mangrove forests. Two groups of mangroves can be identified based on salinity tolerance data, one has a very broad range (0-80‰) and the other has a narrower range ({\textless}40‰) of tolerance. Physiological responses to other environmental gradients in the intertidal zone (e.g., soil texture, redox potential, nutrients) do not appear to be sufficient to influence observed zonation patterns. However, more data are needed to address this question adequately. Biotic factors such as predation on propagules are important influences on the distributional patterns of some groups of mangroves and in certain geographic regions. Competitive interactions may be important in determining some aspects of forest structure, but much more experimental and long-term observational work is needed. A more important consideration is that the dynamics of mangrove forest systems fit within current theories and paradigms developed for other vegetation systems. Ideas of gap-phase dynamics, natural disturbance, and forest mosaics are applicable to mangrove ecosystems and will provide a fruitful avenue for further research.},

We utilized data and experience from ongoing efforts at the Fort Hood Military Installation to build the initial network; then integrate expert input from authors and engineers in propagating the node relationships. Through this approach, we demonstrate how military land managers can integrate varying streams of evidence, including empirical, model generated or expert opinion, into a network for decision support. The example below is developed based upon land management issues within the U.S. Army, but the process can be adapted and implemented across most all ecosystems under some form of land management.},

abstract = {Three mangrove restoration methods were tested at Nu'uuli, Tutuila Island, American Samoa. Since clearing 27 years ago converted the mangrove into a mudflat, the ecosystem was sufficiently altered that it could not self-correct; the ecosystem showed no natural regrowth despite an ample supply of propagules. While several years of monitoring may ultimately be required to determine the project's success, and several decades could be required to fully return the full suite of functions, the project's low-cost, nontechnical restoration techniques, using readily available materials, have proven to be modestly successful, with 38{\%} sapling survival after six months. Several years of monitoring will be necessary to determine if the restoration site's small elevation deficit relative to a reference site ultimately requires modifying the site's physical structure to correct the hydrology. Direct community participation in the project was critical to reduce the risk of human disturbance of the restoration site. One year project costs were about USD {\$}2,150 or USD {\$}13,030 ha(-1). Labor comprised 84{\%} of expenses; replicating the restoration project in developing countries would cost less due to lower wage levels. Six months after initial restoration activities, there was a highly significant difference between Bruguiera qmnorrhiza and Rhizophora mangle sapling survival, with 21 {\%} and 45{\%} of the original 42 R. mangle and 95 B. gmnorrhiza saplings remaining, respectively. The lower R. mangle survival may have resulted from an unavoidable need to source saplings from an area with different environmental conditions than the restoration site. Saplings were transplanted into tires fined with sediment as a simple, low-cost method to raise the elevation of the sediment surface. Saplings were also transplanted adjacent to rebar and without any support mechanism. There was no significant difference in sapling survival by treatment for individual or combined species. The restoration project is a model for the community-based, simple, low-cost approaches to ecological restoration needed in the region. Pilot projects using similar techniques may be worth pursuing at the other 15 Pacific Island countries and territories where mangroves are indigenous.},

abstract = {Recovery of seagrass coverage in Tampa Bay, Florida, to levels observed in 1950 (15,380 ha) is a long-term goal adopted by local, state, federal, and private partners participating in the Tampa Bay Estuary Program. Nitrogen controls initiated in 1980 and continuing through present (from wastewater treatment facilities, stormwater treatment, fertilizer manu - facturers, and power plants) resulted in a 60{\%} total nitrogen load reduction compared to the mid-1970s. As a result, annual water clarity targets (measured as light attenuation and chlorophyll- a concentrations) are being met, and seagrass coverage in 2008 was the highest recorded since 1950 (but still 3,380 ha lower than 1950 coverage). However, seagrass coverage in all areas of the bay is not increasing at the same rate. Wave energy and tidal scour affect longshore sandbars, and in turn seagrass recovery in some areas. Localized water quality factors, including colored dissolved organic matter and turbidity may have impacts on seagrass growth in other areas. Have we had an effect on seagrass recovery in Tampa Bay? Yes, but it will take more than maintaining a successful nutrient management strategy to reach the recovery goal. A multiscale adaptive research and application approach is currently underway to ensure continuation of the upward trend in Tampa Bay seagrass coverage.},

abstract = {In subtropical Tampa Bay, Florida, USA, we evaluated restoration trajectories before and after nutrient management strategies were implemented using long-term trends in nutrient loading, water quality, primary production, and seagrass extent. Following citizen demands for action, reduction in wastewater nutrient loading of approximately 90{\%} in the late 1970s lowered external total nitrogen (TN) loading by more than 50{\%} within three years. Continuing nutrient management actions from public and private sectors were associated with a steadily declining TN load rate and with concomitant reduction in chlorophyll-a concentrations and ambient nutrient concentrations since the mid-1980s, despite an increase of more than 1M people living within the Tampa Bay metropolitan area. Water quality (chlorophyll-a concentration, water clarity as indicated by Secchi disk depth, total nitrogen concentration and dissolved oxygen) and seagrass coverage are approaching conditions observed in the 1950s, before the large increases in human population in the watershed. Following recovery from an extreme weather event in 1997-1998, water clarity increased significantly and seagrass is expanding at a rate significantly different than before the event, suggesting a feedback mechanism as observed in other systems. Key elements supporting the nutrient management strategy and concomitant ecosystem recovery in Tampa Bay include: 1) active community involvement, including agreement about quantifiable restoration goals; 2) regulatory and voluntary reduction in nutrient loadings from point, atmospheric, and nonpoint sources; 3) long-term water quality and seagrass extent monitoring; and 4) a commitment from public and private sectors to work together to attain restoration goals. A shift from a turbid, phytoplankton-based system to a clear water, seagrass-based system that began in the 1980s following comprehensive nutrient loading reductions has resulted in a present-day Tampa Bay which looks and functions much like it did in the relatively pre-disturbance 1950s period.},

abstract = {Hurricanes, typhoons, and other cyclonic disturbances often produce sudden, massive disturbances in estuaries and other coastal ecosystems around the world. Compared with other ecological disturbances, such as prairie and forest fires, tree falls, and coral bleaching events, the effects of hurricanes are usually studied in isolation of each other and rarely as repeated or even ecologically predictable events across an area of sustained hurricane activity. Studies of their effects have rarely contributed to the growing body of theory on ecological disturbance and ecosystem resiliency and they are conspicuously absent from ecological textbooks. Since 1996, there has been an increase in the frequency of hurricane landfalls in the southeastern United States that is predicted to continue for some years into the future (Goldenberg et al. 2001; Emanuel 2005; Webster et al. 2005). Coupled with the availability of results from many water quality and biological monitoring programs now in place in these coastal systems, the increase in hurricane activity now provides an opportunity to begin the systematic investigation of how a series of hurricanes might produce cumulative and perhaps even irreversible effects on coastal ecosystems. One particular example that is highlighted in this special issue of Estuaries and Coasts is the occurrence of four major hurricanes to make landfall in Florida in a two-month period of 2004. In some localities, sequential hurricanes made landfall in close proximity to each other, while in other regions of coastal Florida, the repeated heavy rains associated with the multiple hurricanes had effects that were distinct from the wind and storm surge effects often associated with hurricanes. This special issue of Estuaries and Coasts, which reports investigations of hurricane-mediated disturbances, is an opportunity to describe the individual and cumulative effects of storms on coastal environments and component flora and fauna, to put effects of extreme events in the context of long-term monitoring data sets in multiple estuaries, to examine effects of storms on estuarine management, and to provide the impetus for synthesis and generalization. Although the articles in this issue focus primarily on new findings related to the effects of the 2004 hurricanes on coastal systems, the effects of earlier hurricanes are summarized, and some preliminary reports on effects of the 2005 hurricanes are given.},

abstract = {Coastal waters have been significantly influenced by increased inputs of nutrients that have accompanied population growth in adjacent drainage basins. In Tampa Bay, Florida, USA, the population has quadrupled since 1950. By the late 1970s, eutrophic conditions including phytoplankton and macroalgal blooms and seagrass losses were evident. The focus of improving Tampa Bay is centered on obtaining sufficient water quality necessary for restoring seagrass habitat, estimated to have been 16,400 ha in 1950 but reduced to 8800 ha by 1982. To address these problems, targets for nutrient load reductions along with seagrass restoration goals were developed and actions were implemented to reach adopted targets. Empirical regression models were developed to determine relationships between chlorophyll a concentrations and light attenuation adequate for sustainable seagrass growth. Additional empirical relationships between nitrogen loading and chlorophyll a concentrations were developed to determine how Tampa Bay responds to changes in loads. Data show that when nitrogen load reduction and chlorophyll a targets are met, seagrass cover increases. After nitrogen load reductions and maintenance of chlorophyll a at target levels, seagrass acreage has increased 25{\%} since 1982, although more than 5000 ha of seagrass still require recovery. The cooperation of scientists, managers, and decision makers participating in the Tampa Bay Estuary Program's Nitrogen Management Strategy allows the Tampa Bay estuary to continue to show progress towards reversing many of the problems that once plagued its waters. These results also highlight the importance of a multi-entity watershed management process in maintaining progress towards science-based natural resource goals.},

abstract = {We used 183-m seines to study the effects of canopy damage by Hurricane Char-ley (August 2004) on the use of red mangrove Rhizophora mangle Linnaeus shore-lines by large-bodied ({\textgreater} {\~{}}100 mm SL) fishes in Charlotte Harbor (Florida, USA). No significant relationship was found between proportion of the shoreline that was damaged and fish-assemblage structure in the year following the hurricane; how-ever, temperature, water depth, and salinity did influence fish-assemblage struc-ture. Post-hurricane fish assemblages were not notably different from pre-hurricane (1996–2004) assemblages. Despite wide-ranging loss of canopy, defoliation, and mortality of red mangroves, prop-root structure remained largely intact, which may have minimized gross changes in the assemblages of large-bodied fish along the mangrove shorelines during the first post-hurricane year. The effects of habitat damage on the fish assemblages may yet be manifested due to continued deteriora-tion of existing prop-root structure and the apparent slow rate of recolonization of red mangroves in the area. Also, the effect of widespread mangrove mortality on the many other mangrove functions (e.g., primary productivity, food-web, and nutrient dynamics) may ultimately lead to system-level changes that affect the abundance and condition of large-bodied fish. Mangrove shorelines are important habitats for fishes (Kathiresan and Bingham, 2001), mostly because they provide areas that are valuable for feeding and refuge from predation (Manson et al., 2005a). Evidence suggests that mangrove carbon does not directly contribute to fish diets, but instead that mangroves form substrates for vari-ous epibionts (both primary producers and consumers) that fish may eat (Kieckbusch et al., 2004). Refuge from predators may be provided by canopy shade and prop-root structural complexity (Laegdsgaard and Johnson, 2001, Cocheret de la Morini{\`{e}}re et al., 2004, Ellis and Bell, 2004). There is debate over the value of mangroves as nursery habitat, but juveniles of some species appear to be mangrove-dependent (reviewed by Manson et al., 2005a). Very few studies have documented clear links between fishery catches of finfish and extent of mangroves in adjacent areas (Manson et al., 2005b). Correlations tend to be relatively weak and merely imply enhanced nursery function without directly addressing causative factors (Manson et al., 2005a). Two recent fish-ery-independent studies suggested relatively high fish abundance and species rich-ness in mangrove areas with low anthropogenic degradation (Dankwa and Gordon, 2002, Singkran and Sudara, 2005), although both studies had confounding variables (e.g., distance to sea) that may compromise the overall conclusions. One of the most destructive natural threats to mangroves is the passage of hur-ricanes. Hurricane-associated wind effects include defoliation, snapping of trunks/ limbs, and uprooting, all of which can lead to immediate or delayed mortality of mangroves (Baldwin et al., 2001, Sherman et al., 2001). Susceptibility to damage, mortality rates, and potential for regeneration all vary depending upon mangrove species, location (e.g., fringe or inland), and tree size (Roth, 1992, Imbert et al., 1996, McCoy et al., 1996, Baldwin et al., 2001, Sherman et al., 2001).

abstract = {To use bioassessments to help diagnose or identify the specific environmental stressors affecting estuaries, we need a better understanding of the relationships among sediment chemistry guidelines, ambient toxicity tests, and community metrics. However, this relationship is not simple because metrics generally assess the responses at the community level of biological organization whereas sediment guidelines and ambient toxicity tests generally assess or are based on the responses at the organism level. The relationship may be further complicated by the influence of other chemical and physical variables that affect the bioavailability and toxicity of chemical contaminants in the environment. Between 1990 and 1993, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (USEPA) conducted an Environmental Monitoring and Assessment Program (EMAP) survey of estuarine sites in the Virginian Province of the eastern United States. The surveys collected data on benthic assemblages, physical and chemical habitat characteristics, and sediment chemistry and toxicity. We characterized these estuarine sites as affected by sediment contamination based on the exceedence of sediment guidelines or on ambient sediment toxicity tests (i.e., 10-day Ampelisca abdita survival). Then, benthic invertebrate metrics were compared among affected and unaffected sites to identify metrics sensitive to the contamination. A number of benthic invertebrate metrics differed between groups of sites segregated using the organism-level measures whereas other metrics did not. The difference among metrics appears to depend on the sensitivity of the individual metrics to the stressor gradient represented by metals or persistent organic toxics in sediments because the insensitive metrics do not effectively quantify the changes in the benthic invertebrate assemblage associated with these stressors. The significant relationships suggest that a relationship exists between the organismlevel effects assessed by chemistry or ambient toxicity tests and the community-level effects assessed by community metrics and that the organism-level effects are predictive, to some extent, of community-level effects.},

abstract = {As more success is achieved in restoring lakes and estuaries from the impacts of nutrient pollution, there is increased opportunity to evaluate the scientific, social, and policy factors associated with achieving restoration goals. We examined case studies where deliberate actions to reduce nutrient pollution and restore ecosystems resulted in ecological recovery. Prospective cases were identified from scientific literature and technical documents for lakes and estuaries with: (1) scientific evidence of nutrient pollution; (2) restoration actions taken to mitigate nutrient pollution; and (3) documented ecological improvement. Using these criteria, we identified 9 estuaries and 7 lakes spanning countries, climatic regions, physical types, depths, and watershed areas. Among 16 case studies ultimately included, 8 achieved improvements short of stated restoration goals. Five more were successful initially, but condition subsequently declined. Three of the case studies achieved their goals fully and are currently managing to maintain the restored condition. We examined each case to identify both common attributes of nutrient management, grouped into ‘themes', and variations on those attributes, which were coded into categorical variables based on thorough review of documents associated with each case. The themes and variables were organized into a broad conceptual model illustrating how they relate to each other and to nutrient management outcomes. We then explored relationships among the themes and variables using multiple correspondence analysis (MCA). Results of the MCA suggested that the attributes most associated with achieving restoration goals include: (1) leadership by a dedicated watershed management agency; (2) governance through a bottom-up collaborative process; (3) a strategy that set numeric targets based on a specific ecological goal; and (4) actions to reduce nutrient loads from all sources. While our study did not provide a comprehensive road map to successful nutrient management, it suggested attributes that could be emulated in future efforts. The quantitative approach that was applied could be used to provide ongoing analysis as new examples of nutrient management success emerge.},

abstract = {This work presents empirical data from several databases. Empirical data ultimately form the basis for most ecological/environmental studies, and this work uses what may be the most comprehensive data set ever compiled concerning relationships between chlorophyll-a concentrations, nitrogen, phosphorus, and salinity, since the data in this study concerns about 500 lakes and coastal areas. The focus has been on how variations between systems in median summer values of chlorophyll-a concentrations (Chl) depend on variations in total nitrogen, total phosphorus, and salinity. The salinities range from 0 to 275 PSS78 in hypersaline systems; the median salinity is 12.5. The range in nutrients is from ultraoligotrophic (totalP, or TP, is less than 1  g/L) to hypertrophic systems (TP is greater than 1000  g/L). The chlorophyll values vary from 0.12 to 60  g/L. Results showed that there is a minimum in the Chl/TP ratio in the salinity range between 2 and 5, followed by an increase up to a salinity range of 10–15, and then a continuous reduction in the Chl/TP ratio until a minimum value of about 0.012 is reached in hypersaline systems. We have also identiﬁed a threshold value for the salinity. In systems dominated by freshwater inﬂuences, the ratio of Chl to total nitrogen, or TN, increases steadily from about 0.008 in lakes to 0.02 when the salinity is 10. At higher salinities than 10, the Chl/TN ratio decreases in a nonlinear fashion. We have also presented several empirical models to predict chlorophyll concentrations from levels of TP, TN, and salinity. The model predicting Chl from TP and salinity is generally the best one. The next best model according to the criteria (r2 value, median error, and standard deviation for the error) is the model using TN and salinity. Models not including salinity predict chlorophyll less well. },

abstract = {Restoration of aquatic ecosystems is a high priority regionally and globally, yet only recently have such efforts adopted holistic approaches that include the restoration of streams and rivers flowing to coastal areas. As the largest estuary in the US, the Chesapeake Bay has been the focus of one of the most high-profile restoration programs ever undertaken in North America. While the primary emphasis has been on tidal waters, freshwater tributary clean-up strategies have recently been developed. We have compiled the first comprehensive database of over 4700 existing river and stream restoration projects in the Chesapeake Bay Watershed (CBW) to examine where dollars are being spent, what issues motivate restoration, and what approaches are used. By conservative estimates, in excess of {\$}400 million has been invested in restoration projects since 1990. The majority of projects were implemented to restore forest vegetation in riparian areas and improve water quality. Although the CBW has an extremely high density of restoration activities relative to other regions of the US, only 5.4{\%} of the project records indicated that related monitoring of project performance has occurred. To provide cost-effective management solutions, we recommend that a centralized tracking system be developed that includes restoration projects associated with both tidal and non-tidal waterways, along with a substantial increase in investment in the comprehensive monitoring of individual projects following implementation.},

abstract = {Ecological (poleward) regime shifts are a predicted response to climate change and have been well documented in terrestrial and more recently ocean species. Coastal zones are amongst the most susceptible ecosystems to the impacts of climate change, yet studies particularly focused on mangroves are lacking. Recent studies have highlighted the critical ecosystem services mangroves provide, yet there is a lack of data on temporal global population response. This study tests the notion that mangroves are migrating poleward at their biogeographical limits across the globe in line with climate change. A coupled systematic approach utilising literature and land surface and air temperature data was used to determine and validate the global poleward extent of the mangrove population. Our findings indicate that whilst temperature (land and air) have both increased across the analysed time periods, the data we located showed that mangroves were not consistently extending their latitudinal range across the globe. Mangroves, unlike other marine and terrestrial taxa, do not appear to be experiencing a poleward range expansion despite warming occurring at the present distributional limits. Understanding failure for mangroves to realise the global expansion facilitated by climate warming may require a focus on local constraints, including local anthropogenic pressures and impacts, oceanographic, hydrological, and topographical conditions.

@article{Hobbs2001,
abstract = {The extent of human-induced change and damage to Earth's ecosystems renders ecosystem repair an essen- tial part of our future survival strategy, and this de- mands that restoration ecology provide effective con- ceptual and practical tools for this task. We argue that restoration ecology has to be an integral component of land management in today's world, and to be broadly applicable, has to have a clearly articulated conceptual basis. This needs to recognize that most ecosystems are dynamic and hence restoration goals cannot be based on static attributes. Setting clear and achiev- able goals is essential, and these should focus on the desired characteristics for the system in the future, rather than in relation to what these were in the past. Goal setting requires that there is a clear understand- ing of the restoration options available (and the rela- tive costs of different options). The concept of restora- tion thresholds suggests that options are determined by the current state of the system in relation to biotic and abiotic thresholds. A further important task is the development of effective and easily measured success criteria. Many parameters could be considered for in- clusion in restoration success criteria, but these are of- ten ambiguous or hard to measure. Success criteria need to relate clearly back to specific restoration goals. If restoration ecology is to be successfully prac- ticed as part of humanity's response to continued eco- system change and degradation, restoration ecologists need to rise to the challenges of meshing science},

abstract = {Understanding spatial variation in carbon storage in natural habitats is critical for climate change mitigation efforts such as REDD. Terrestrial forests are being mapped with increasing accuracy, but the distribution of ``blue carbon'' in marine ecosystems remains poorly understood. We reviewed the literature to obtain field data on carbon storage and fluxes in mangroves world-wide. Using this material we developed a climate-based model for potential mangrove above-ground biomass (AGB) with almost four times the explanatory power of the only previous published model. From this model, we present the first ever global map of potential mangrove AGB and estimate a total global mangrove AGB of 2.83 Pg, with an average of 184.8 t ha−1. Data on other carbon stocks and fluxes confirm the importance of mangroves in carbon accounting. The map highlights the high variability in mangrove AGB and indicates areas that should be prioritised for mangrove conservation and restoration.},

Mangroves are coastal ecosystems providing numerous ecosystem services affecting both marine and terrestrial resources. In addition, they contain substantial carbon stocks and, due to high rates of deforestation, are significant sources of carbon emissions. Because of their value as carbon stocks and sinks and their numerous other benefits, mangroves could be excellent candidates for carbon mitigation programmes including Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Forest Degradation, and Enhancing Forest Carbon Stocks in Developing Countries (REDD+). This publication outlines biologically relevant and statistically valid approaches to the efficient and accurate assessment of ecosystem structure, biomass and carbon stocks of mangrove forests},

abstract = {We developed an algorithm for calculating habitat suitability for seagrasses and related submerged aquatic vegetation (SAV) at coastal sites where monitoring data are available for five water quality variables that govern light availability at the leaf surface. We developed independent estimates of the minimum light required for SAV survival both as a percentage of surface light passing through the water column to the depth of SAV growth (PLW min) and as a percentage of light reaching leaves through the epiphyte layer (PLL min). Values were computed by applying, as inputs to this algorithm, statistically derived values for water quality variables that correspond to thresholds for SAV presence in Chesapeake Bay. These estimates of PLW min and PLL min compared well with the values established from a literature review. Calculations account for tidal range, and total light attenuation is partitioned into water column and epiphyte contributions. Water column attenuation is further partitioned into effects of chlorophyll a (chl a), total suspended solids (TSS) and other substances. We used this algorithm to predict potential SAV presence throughout the Bay where calcu-lated light available at plant leaves exceeded PLL min . Predictions closely matched results of aerial photographic moni-toring surveys of SAV distribution. Correspondence between predictions and observations was particularly strong in the mesohaline and polyhaline regions, which contain 75–80{\%} of all potential SAV sites in this estuary. The method also allows for independent assessment of effects of physical and chemical factors other than light in limiting SAV growth and survival. Although this algorithm was developed with data from Chesapeake Bay, its general structure allows it to be calibrated and used as a quantitative tool for applying water quality data to define suitability of specific sites as habitats for SAV survival in diverse coastal environments worldwide.},

abstract = {Mangrove water biogeochemistry has been frequently studied under tropical climates, but less is known regarding mangroves in semi-arid climates. In this study, we examine the carbon and nutrient biogeochemistry in a mangrove tidal creek and in the main branch of a semi-arid estuary in New Caledonia. Porewater seepage represents a source of nutrients (DON, NH4 +, and DIP), carbon (DOC and CO2), and alkalinity for the water column, but seawater dilution of the mangrove inputs is observed. Spatial and tidal variations in CO2 fluxes along the tidal creek suggest that porewater seepage is a driver of CO2 emission into the atmosphere. Large seasonal and spatial differences in the biogeochemical functioning of the main channel are observed and are mainly related to the seasonal rainfall pattern. During the rainy season, the watershed influences the entire estuary, which exhibits a typical positive circulation. During the dry season, the estuary turns into a salt-plug region with positive and negative circulations in the upper and lower reaches, respectively. In this case, the upper and lower reaches seem to function independently, and the biogeochemical functioning of their water column is not controlled by the same processes. Surprisingly, pCO2@27 °C values tend to be higher during the dry season, as do the total alkalinity (TAlk) values, while the pH values exhibit an opposite trend. Moreover, the TAlk values are higher in the lower reaches during the wet season and in the upper reaches during the dry season. These results indicate high in situ biogeochemical reactions and high porewater influence during the dry season, likely because of a low flushing rate and high water residence time after salt plug establishment. Although our results suggest that salt plugs may significantly affect the water column's biogeochemistry and may promote CO2 emissions of mangrove-derived carbon, further investigations, especially mass balance studies, are required to quantify their role in the biogeochemical functioning of such estuarine systems. {\textcopyright} 2016, Coastal and Estuarine Research Federation.},

abstract = {The costs to successfully restore both the vegetative cover and ecological functions of a mangrove forest have been reported to range from USD{\$}225/ha to USD{\$}216,000/ha. Unpublished data would indicate that the even higher costs, as much as USD{\$}500,000/ha, has been spent on individual projects. These are obviously cost prohibitive amounts for most countries seeking to restore damaged mangroves. I divide the types of mangrove restoration projects into three categories: (1) planting alone, (2) hydrologic restoration, with and without planting, and (3) excavation or fill, with and without planting. The first type, planting only, although inexpensive (e.g.: USD{\$}100-200/ha) usually does not succeed due to a failure to appreciate the physiological tolerances of mangroves to tidal inundation. Even if it works, the result is often replacement of one productive marine habitat, like seagrass meadows with mangroves, a questionable trade-off. The second type, hydrologic restoration, can be done for similar costs, and with proper planning has a high success rate. Successful restoration of abandoned shrimp aquaculture ponds is an example of this method. Planting should only be done if natural recolonization fails, and can double the cost of a project. Scientific data indicates that using this method, ecological functions are quickly restored, with fish populations typically reaching reference site diversity and densities within 5 years. The third type, excavation and fill, is the most expensive due to the high costs of large scale earthmoving. It is only a viable option in more 2 developed countries, and may not be a cost-effective means of restoration except under limited circumstances.},

abstract = {Great potential exists to reverse the loss of mangrove forests worldwide through the application of basic principles of ecological restoration using ecological engineering approaches, including careful cost evaluations prior to design and construction. Previous documented attempts to restore mangroves, where successful, have largely concentrated on creation of plantations of mangroves consisting of just a few species, and targeted for harvesting as wood products, or temporarily used to collect eroded soil and raise intertidal areas to usable terrestrial agricultural uses. I document here the importance of assessing the existing hydrology of natural extant mangrove ecosystems, and applying this knowledge to first protect existing mangroves, and second to achieve successful and cost-effective ecological restoration, if needed. Previous research has documented the general principle that mangrove forests worldwide exist largely in a raised and sloped platform above mean sea level, and inundated at approximately 30{\%}, or less of the time by tidal waters. More frequent flooding causes stress and death of these tree species. Prevention of such damage requires application of the same understanding of mangrove hydrology. ?? 2005 Elsevier B.V.

abstract = {Mangrove forest restoration projects commonly fail to achieve significant plant cover for two reasons: because there is a misunderstanding of mangrove forest hydrology, or, acceptance of the false assumption that simply planting mangroves is all that is required to establish a fully-functional mangrove ecosystem. Even restoration projects that meet a restoration goal within 3–5 yrs often fail to provide adequate habitat for fish and invertebrates. Here we discuss how fish and mangrove ecosystems are coupled in time and space, offer several restoration strategies that match these couplings, and provide simple sequential checklist of design tasks to use to prevent most failures. Tidal hydrology must be carefully designed to incorporate fish habitat, including tidal creeks, to provide access and low tide refuge for mobile nekton because the mangrove forest floor is generally flooded by tidal waters less than 30 percent of the time. A fully successful restoration design must mimic tidal stream morphology and hydrology along an estuarine gradient across a heterogeneous mixture of mangrove ecosystem communities.},

Tampa Bay, as an urbanized estuary, is subject to the input of watershed sources of chemical contaminants, including metals, pesticides, and organic chemicals. Although the use of biological indicators and their incorporation into multi-metric indices is not new, the refinement and applications of such techniques for determining environmental condition still require further development and exploration. We present a single Tampa Bay Benthic Index (TBBI) that was developed specifically for Tampa Bay. Stepwise discriminant analysis was applied to a comprehensive list of potential benthic metrics. Results from the stepwise procedure identified the metrics that best discriminated between "healthy" and "degraded" conditions, as defined by sediment contaminant effect levels and dissolved oxygen. Discriminant analysis was then applied to the resultant three variables to determine the linear combination for the index. {\textcopyright} 2006 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.},

abstract = {River restoration is a main emphasis of river management in European countries. Cross-national com-parisons of its implementation are still rare in scientific literature. Based on French and German national censuses, this study compares river restoration practices and mon-itoring by analysing 102 French and 270 German projects. This comparison aims to draw a spatial and temporal fra-mework of restoration practices in both countries to identify potential drivers of cross-national similarities and differ-ences. The results underline four major trends: (1) a lag of almost 15 years in river restoration implementation between France and Germany, with a consequently higher share of projects in Germany than in France, (2) substantial simila-rities in restored reach characteristics, short reach length, small rivers, and in " agricultural " areas, (3) good corre-spondences between stressors identified and restoration measures implemented. Morphological alterations were the most important highlighted stressors. River morphology enhancement, especially instream enhancements, were the most frequently implemented restoration measures. Some differences exist in specific restoration practices, as river continuity restoration were most frequently implemented in French projects, while large wood introduction or channel re-braiding were most frequently implemented in German projects, and (4) some quantitative and qualitative differ-ences in monitoring practices and a significant lack of project monitoring, especially in Germany compared to France. These similarities and differences between Ger-many and France in restoration application and monitoring possibly result from a complex set of drivers that might be difficult to untangle (e.g., environmental, technical, poli-tical, cultural).},

abstract = {Seasonal responses in estuarine metabolism (primary production, respiration, and net metabolism) were examined using two complementary approaches. Total ecosystem metabolism rates were calculated from dissolved oxygen time series using Odum's open water method. Water column rates were calculated from oxygen-based bottle experiments. The study was conducted over a spring-summer season in the Pensacola Bay estuary at a shallow seagrass-dominated site and a deeper bare-bottomed site. Water column integrated gross production rates more than doubled (58.7 to 130.9 mmol O2 m−2 day−1) from spring to summer, coinciding with a sharp increase in water column chlorophyll-a, and a decrease in surface salinity. As expected, ecosystem gross production rates were consistently higher than water column rates but showed a different spring-summer pattern, decreasing at the shoal site from 197 to 168 mmol O2 m−2 day−1 and sharply increasing at the channel site from 93.4 to 197.4 mmol O2 m−2 day−1. The consistency among approaches was evaluated by calculating residual metabolism rates (ecosystem − water column). At the shoal site, residual gross production rates decreased from spring to summer from 176.8 to 99.1 mmol O2 m−2 day−1 but were generally consistent with expectations for seagrass environments, indicating that the open water method captured both water column and benthic processes. However, at the channel site, where benthic production was strongly light-limited, residual gross production varied from 15.7 mmol O2 m−2 day−1 in spring to 86.7 mmol O2 m−2 day−1 in summer. The summer rates were much higher than could be realistically attributed to benthic processes and likely reflected a violation of the open water method due to water column stratification. While the use of sensors for estimating complex ecosystem processes holds promise for coastal monitoring programs, careful attention to the sampling design, and to the underlying assumptions of the methods, is critical for correctly interpreting the results. This study demonstrated how using a combination of approaches yielded a fuller understanding of the ecosystem response to hydrologic and seasonal variability.},

To rehabilitate the coastal ecosystems, some mangrove has been planted with spacing distances of 1x1 m with minimal forest management. Those dense-spaced stands enhanced light competitions and inhibit growth. These poor quality and immature stands that reach an early climax in 10-15 years were observed in two adjacent sites near Nam Dinh and Thanh Hoa in northern Vietnam, where Kandelia candel were planted. To cultivate the resurgent stands and increase their growth, thinning mangrove is essential. Stand densities of the mangrove trees with and without the thinning practice were 17,800 and 5,200 trees ha-1, respectively. Their potential of the maximum above-ground biomass were 303 and 239 Mg ha-1, respectively. However, quality of the single tree was largely different whether or not thinning practice is conducted, as the thinned one of 46 kg tree-1 was about three times higher than the non-thinned of 17 kg tree-1. The thinning practice enhances stand biomass growth with improved growth condition in the forest, which advances carbon sequestration for the climate change mitigation. The cultivated trees also ensure the climate change adaptation of coastal protection, fishery products and bio-diversity. Synergizing mitigation and adaptation strategies with the mangrove thinning would enhance the benefits for coastal communities most vulnerable to climate change},

The others are Continuing the Journey Amongst Mangroves by Barry Clough, and Useful Products from Mangrove and other Coastal Plants by Shigeyuki Baba, Hung Tuck Chan and Sanit Aksornkoae. This book is about mangrove plants and animals that colonise the main part of the intertidal zone in the tropics and subtropics. It highlights the structure, function, state of health, and as importantly, the sustainable economic and ecological management of mangrove forests. This book is not written for the professionals but aimed more at semi-professionals, students and those who need an introduction to mangroves at a higher than just a superficial treatment. The confusion with rehabilitation of mangroves after the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami strongly suggests that such a book would fulfil a need. The authors also wish to share their considerable experience working (mainly in the field in hands-on situations) in some of the most biologically diverse and luxuriant mangroves in the world. It is not the intention of this book to provide a highly technical review of the subject. As such, the references are not extensive but enough to point the way for further reading. This makes for easier reading. This book is also structured in such a way that the photographs, with their own captions, can be read independently from the text. The boxes provide further details and need not be read with the text or photographs.},

abstract = {We live in an era of unprecedented ecological change in which ecologists and natural resource managers are increasingly challenged to anticipate and prepare for the ecological effects of future global change. In this study, we investigated the potential effect of winter climate change upon salt marsh and mangrove forest foundation species in the southeastern United States. Our research addresses the following three questions: (1) What is the relationship between winter climate and the presence and abundance of mangrove forests relative to salt marshes; (2) How vulnerable are salt marshes to winter climate change-induced mangrove forest range expansion; and (3) What is the potential future distribution and relative abundance of mangrove forests under alternative winter climate change scenarios? We developed simple winter climate-based models to predict mangrove forest distribution and relative abundance using observed winter temperature data (1970-2000) and mangrove forest and salt marsh habitat data. Our results identify winter climate thresholds for salt marsh-mangrove forest interactions and highlight coastal areas in the southeastern United States (e.g., Texas, Louisiana, and parts of Florida) where relatively small changes in the intensity and frequency of extreme winter events could cause relatively dramatic landscape-scale ecosystem structural and functional change in the form of poleward mangrove forest migration and salt marsh displacement. The ecological implications of these marsh-to-mangrove forest conversions are poorly understood, but would likely include changes for associated fish and wildlife populations and for the supply of some ecosystem goods and services.},

abstract = {The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) has developed the Watershed Deposition Tool (WDT) to calculate from the Community Multiscale Air Quality (CMAQ) model output the nitrogen, sulfur, and mercury deposition rates to watersheds and their sub-basins. The CMAQ model simulates from first principles the transport, transformation, and removal of atmospheric pollutants. We applied WDT to estimate the atmospheric deposition of reactive nitrogen (N) to Tampa Bay and its watershed. For 2002 and within the boundaries of Tampa Bay's watershed, modeled atmospheric deposition rates averaged 13.3 kg N ha-1 yr-1 and ranged from 6.24 kg N ha-1 yr-1 at the bay's boundary with Gulf of Mexico to 21.4 kg N ha-1 yr-1 near Tampa's urban core, based on a 12-km × 12-km grid cell size. CMAQ-predicted loading rates were 1,080 metric tons N yr-1 to Tampa Bay and 8,280 metric tons N yr-1 to the land portion of its watershed. If we assume a watershed-to-bay transfer rate of 18{\%} for indirect loading, our estimates of the 2002 direct and indirect loading rates to Tampa Bay were 1,080 metric tons N and 1,490 metric tons N, respectively, for an atmospheric loading of 2,570 metric tons N or 71{\%} of the total N loading to Tampa Bay. To evaluate the potential impact of the U.S. EPA Clean Air Interstate Rule (CAIR, replaced with Cross-State Air Pollution Rule), Tier 2 Vehicle and Gasoline Sulfur Rules, Heavy Duty Highway Rule, and Non-Road Diesel Rule, we compared CMAQ outputs between 2020 and 2002 simulations, with only the emissions inventories changed. The CMAQ-projected change in atmospheric loading rates between these emissions inventories was 857 metric tons N to Tampa Bay, or about 24{\%} of the 2002 loading of 3,640 metric tons N to Tampa Bay from all sources.Air quality modeling reveals that atmospheric deposition of reactive nitrogen (N) contributes a significant fraction to Tampa Bay's total N loading from external sources. Regulatory drivers that lower nitrogen oxide emissions from power plants and motor vehicles are important to bay management strategies, which seek to improve water quality through N load reduction. {\textcopyright} 2013 Copyright 2013 A{\&}WMA.},

abstract = {We assessed the sensitivity of a viviparous estuarine tree species, Rhizophora mangle, to historic sublethal mutagenic stress across a fine spatial scale by comparing the frequency of trees producing albino propagules in historically contaminated (n4) and uncontaminated (n11) forests in Tampa Bay, Florida, USA. Data from uncontaminated forests were used to provide estimates of background mutation rates. We also determined whether other fitness parameters were negatively correlated with mutagenic stress (e.g., degree of outcrossing and numbers of reproducing trees km1 ). Contaminated sites in Tampa Bay had sig- nificantly higher frequencies of trees that were heterozygous for albinism per 1000 total reproducing trees (FHT) than uncontaminated forests (mean  SE: 11.4  4.3 vs 4.3  0.73, P0.022). Two sites that were contaminated by oil failed to show elevated FHT, although in the first instance, the mutagenic effects of the oil may have been reduced by several weeks of weathering in open water before coming ashore, and in the second  25 yrs of subsequent recruitment and tree replacement may have allowed an initial elevation in the FHT to decay. Patterns of FHT were not explained by distance from the bay mouth or the degree of urbanization. However, there was a significant positive relationship between tree size and FHT (r0.83, P0.018), which suggests that forests with older or larger trees provide a more lasting record of cumulative mutagenic stress. No other fitness parameters correlated with FHT. There was a difference in FHT between two latitudes, as determined by comparing Tampa Bay with literature values for Puerto Rico. The sensitivity of this bioassay for the effects of mutagens will facilitate future monitoring of contamination events and comparisons of bay-wide recovery in future decades. Development of a database of FHT values for a range of subtropical and tropical estuaries is underway that will provide a baseline against which to compare mutational consequences of global change.},

abstract = {Environmental decision support intends to use the best available scientific knowledge to help decision makers find and evaluate management alternatives. The goal of this process is to achieve the best fulfillment of societal objectives. This requires a careful analysis of (i) how scientific knowledge can be represented and quantified, (ii) how societal preferences can be described and elicited, and (iii) how these concepts can best be used to support communication with authorities, politicians, and the public in environmental management. The goal of this paper is to discuss key requirements for a conceptual framework to address these issues and to suggest how these can best be met. We argue that a combination of probability theory and scenario planning with multi-attribute utility theory fulfills these requirements, and discuss adaptations and extensions of these theories to improve their application for supporting environmental decision making. With respect to (i) we suggest the use of intersubjective probabilities, if required extended to imprecise probabilities, to describe the current state of scientific knowledge. To address (ii), we emphasize the importance of value functions, in addition to utilities, to support decisions under risk. We discuss the need for testing "non-standard" value aggregation techniques, the usefulness of flexibility of value functions regarding attribute data availability, the elicitation of value functions for sub-objectives from experts, and the consideration of uncertainty in value and utility elicitation. With respect to (iii), we outline a well-structured procedure for transparent environmental decision support that is based on a clear separation of scientific prediction and societal valuation. We illustrate aspects of the suggested methodology by its application to river management in general and with a small, didactical case study on spatial river rehabilitation prioritization.},

abstract = {{\textcopyright} Springer International Publishing AG 2017. This book presents a comprehensive overview and analysis of mangrove ecological processes, structure, and function at the local, biogeographic, and global scales and how these properties interact to provide key ecosystem services to society. The analysis is based on an international collaborative effort that focuses on regions and countries holding the largest mangrove resources and encompasses the major biogeographic and socio-economic settings of mangrove distribution. Given the economic and ecological importance of mangrove wetlands at the global scale, the chapters aim to integrate ecological and socio-economic perspectives on mangrove function and management using a system-level hierarchical analysis framework. The book explores the nexus between mangrove ecology and the capacity for ecosystem services, with an emphasis on thresholds, multiple stressors, and local conditions that determine this capacity. The interdisciplinary approach and illustrative study cases included in the book will provide valuable resources in data, information, and knowledge about the current status of one of the most productive coastal ecosystem in the world.},

abstract = {The Ogawa passive sampler (Ogawa USA, Pompano Beach, Florida) is a useful tool for monitoring atmospheric ammonia (NH3(g)) concentrations and assessing the effects of agricultural waste management practices on NH3(g) emissions. The Ogawa sampler, with filter-discs impregnated with citric acid, was used to trap and determine NH3(g) concentrations in a variety of agricultural settings. A wide range of NH3(g) concentrations can be monitored by varying the sampler exposure time, provided that no more than ∼10$\mu$g of NH3-N are adsorbed on the acid-coated filters. Concentrations less than 1$\mu$g NH3-Nm-3can be detected using long deployments (≤14 days), while concentrations as great as 10mg NH3-Nm-3may be determined in very short (e.g. 5min) deployments. Reproducibility ranged from 5{\%} to 10{\%} over the range of concentrations studied and passive determinations of NH3(g) were similar to those determined using dilute-acid gas scrubbers. Background levels of NH3(g) at a non-agricultural site in southern Delaware were typically {\textless}1$\mu$g NH3-Nm-3. The air entering a chicken house was 10$\mu$g NH3-Nm-3, reflecting the background levels in agricultural settings in this region. Within the house, concentrations ≤8.5mg NH3-Nm-3were observed, reflecting the high rates of NH3(g) emission from chicken excreta. Using measured NH3(g) concentrations and poultry house ventilation rates, we estimate that each broiler grown to production size over 6 weeks contributes approximately 19±3g of NH3-N to the atmosphere, a value consistent with other published results. {\textcopyright} 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd.

@article{Rumson2017,
abstract = {Increasing numbers of people are living in and using coastal areas. Combined with the presence of pervasive coastal threats, such as flooding and erosion, this is having widespread impacts on coastal populations, infrastructure and ecosystems. For the right adaptive strategies to be adopted, and planning decisions to be made, rigorous evaluation of the available options is required. This evaluation hinges on the availability and use of suitable datasets. For knowledge to be derived from coastal datasets, such data needs to be combined and analysed in an effective manner. This paper reviews a wide range of literature relating to data-driven approaches to coastal risk evaluation, revealing how limitations have been imposed on many of these methods, due to restrictions in computing power and access to data. The rapidly emerging field of ‘Big Data' can help overcome many of these hurdles. ‘Big Data' involves powerful computer infrastructures, enabling storage, processing and real-time analysis of large volumes and varieties of data, in a fast and reliable manner. Through consideration of examples of how ‘Big Data' technologies are being applied to fields related to coastal risk, it becomes apparent that geospatial Big Data solutions hold clear potential to improve the process of risk based decision making on the coast. ‘Big Data' does not provide a stand-alone solution to the issues and gaps outlined in this paper, yet these technological methods hold the potential to optimise data-driven approaches, enabling robust risk profiles to be generated for coastal regions.},

abstract = {ABSTRACT: A portion of Hillsborough Bay (Tampa, Florida, USA), part of the Tampa Bay estuary, undergoes annual summer defaunation, presumably due to hypoxia. Dissolved oxygen levels are very low ({\textless} 1.0 mg 1-l) at the times of the defaunations. In the ensuing period between defaunations, recolonization occurs. Monthly samples for 42 consecutive months were collected by SCUBA-diver-operated, hand-held PVC cores and screened through a 0.5 mm sieve. Eight species, Mysella planulata, Arnpelisca abdita, Streblospio benedicti, Grandjdierella bonnieroides, Mulinia lateralis, Mediomastus californiensis, Cyclaspls sp. and Nereissuccinea were numerically dominant, accounting for more than 95 {\%} of the total density during the entire penod. These 8 species are all classified as r-strategists and utilize several dispersal mechanisms to attain large populations rapidly. Circumstantial evidence is present},

abstract = {Many coastal marine ecosystems are threatened by anthropogenic activities, but often, the best way to restore and protect these important ecosystems is unclear. Conventional wisdom suggests that the 2 most effective conservation actions to benefit coastal marine ecosystems are implementation of marine protected areas or, alternatively, reduction of land-based threats. Active marine restoration is typically considered a low-priority option, in part due to high costs and low success rates. But does this conventional wisdom hold up to closer scrutiny? We developed a model to ask: should we restore or protect, on either the land or in the ocean, to maximise the extent of coastal marine ecosystems? We based the model on seagrass meadows and adjacent catchments in Queensland, Australia. Surprisingly, we found that direct, active marine restoration can be the most cost-effective approach to maximising extent of marine ecosystems over longer (decades-long) timescales. There is, however, substantial uncertainty in our understanding of the dynamics of complex linked land–sea ecosystems. Further, geomorphological and ecological conditions vary geographically. Therefore, we also used the model to investigate how uncertainty in key parameters affects decision-making outcomes. Our results can be used to guide investment into coastal marine conservation in the absence of complex, region-specific modelling.},

abstract = {Water quality monitoring is a cornerstone of environmental protection and ambient monitoring provides managers with the critical data they need to take informed action. Unlike site-specific monitoring that is at the heart of regulatory permit compliance, regional monitoring can provide an integrated, holistic view of the environment, allowing managers to obtain a more complete picture of natural variability and cumulative impacts, and more effectively prioritize management actions. By reviewing four long-standing regional monitoring programs that cover portions of all three coasts in the United States–Chesapeake Bay, Tampa Bay, Southern California Bight, and San Francisco Bay–important insights can be gleaned about the benefits that regional monitoring provides to managers. These insights include the underlying reasons that make regional monitoring programs successful, the challenges to maintain relevance and viability in the face of ever-changing technology, competing demands and shifting management priorities. The lessons learned can help other managers achieve similar successes as they seek to establish and reinvigorate their own monitoring programs.},

As sessile long-living plants, they need this high level of genetic variation for adaptation to highly variable environmental conditions. A set of population genetic processes such as the mating system, gene flow, selection, and migration determine the genetic composition of a tree population. First we will give an introduction and overview on the most important processes and their impact on the genetic diversity of tropical trees, and then we will go in more details for some of the processes. The genetic diversity is of fundamental function for the stability of forest ecosystems. Thus adequate measures on gene conservation are very important. We will cover this topic with a specific chapter. More recently with the advance of genomics and molecular genetics, we have a broad set of molecular markers in hand for diagnostic purposes. We highlight as one important application the use of gene markers and DNA bar coding for tree species identification and as a tool to fight against illegal logging. Finally we will give an introduction to tree breeding programs and provenance tests in the tropics.},

abstract = {The Tampa Bay estuary is a unique and valued ecosystem that currently thrives between subtropical and temperate climates along Florida's west-central coast. The watershed is considered urbanized (42 {\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} lands developed); however, a suite of critical coastal habitats still persists. Current management efforts are focused toward restoring the historic balance of these habitat types to a benchmark 1950s period. We have modeled the anticipated changes to a suite of habitats within the Tampa Bay estuary using the sea level affecting marshes model under various sea level rise (SLR) scenarios. Modeled changes to the distribution and coverage of mangrove habitats within the estuary are expected to dominate the overall proportions of future critical coastal habitats. Modeled losses in salt marsh, salt barren, and coastal freshwater wetlands by 2100 will significantly affect the progress achieved in "Restoring the Balance" of these habitat types over recent periods. Future land management and acquisition priorities within the Tampa Bay estuary should consider the impending effects of both continued urbanization within the watershed and climate change. This requires the recognition that: (1) the Tampa Bay estuary is trending towards a mangrove-dominated system; (2) the current management paradigm of "Restoring the Balance" may no longer provide realistic, attainable goals; (3) restoration that creates habitat mosaics will prove more resilient in the future; and (4) establishing subtidal and upslope "refugia" may be a future strategy in this urbanized estuary to allow sensitive habitat types (e.g., seagrass and salt barren) to persist under anticipated climate change and SLR impacts. {\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\textcopyright}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} 2013 Springer Science+Business Media New York.},

abstract = {Historically, significant impacts to Tampa Bay's water quality (e.g. chlorophyll-a concentrations) and ecosystem (e.g. seagrass coverage) have been documented as a result of early coastal development and urban expansion that occurred between the 1950s and 1980s. Since this time, Tampa Bay's estuarine water quality and ecosystems have significantly recovered. A long-term water quality monitoring program, first established by the Environmental Protection Commission of Hillsborough County (EPCHC) in 1972, was instrumental in the development of water quality management targets and regulatory thresholds related to the recovery of seagrass that helped guide restoration activities in the Bay from the 1980s to present. The EPCHC monitoring program has provided over 40 years of consistent and quality assured data that have been used to document Tampa Bay's ecosystem recovery, as well as, guide future research, monitoring, and management actions. Forecasted future pressures of continuing coastal population growth and climate change impacts further necessitate the need to maintain long-term water quality monitoring efforts in the Tampa Bay estuary. Maintenance of a robust estuarine monitoring program will not only help to identify future risks to the important environmental assets represented in the Tampa Bay estuary, but also help to identify potential risks to Tampa Bay's economic vitality that are garnered from maintaining a “healthy” Tampa Bay.},

abstract = {The wetlands surrounding Tampa Bay, Florida were extensively ditched for mosquito control in the 1950s. Spoil from ditch construction was placed adjacent to the wetlands ditches creating mound-like features (spoil-mounds). These mounds represent a loss of 14{\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\%}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} of the wetland area in Tampa Bay. Spoil mounds interfere with tidal flow and are locations for non-native plants to colonize (e.g., Schinus terebinthifolius). Removal of the spoil mounds to eliminate exotic plants, restore native vegetation, and re-establish natural hydrology is a restoration priority for environmental managers. Hydro-leveling, a new technique, was tested in a mangrove forest restoration project in 2004. Hydro-leveling uses a high pressure stream of water to wash sediment from the spoil mound into the adjacent wetland and ditch. To assess the effectiveness of this technique, we conducted vegetation surveys in areas that were hydro-leveled and in non-hydro-leveled areas 3 years post-project. Adult Schinus were reduced but not eliminated from hydro-leveled mounds. Schinus seedlings however were absent from hydro-leveled sites. Colonization by native species was sparse. Mangrove seedlings were essentially absent (≈2 m-2) from the centers of hydro-leveled mounds and were in low density on their edges (17 m-2) in comparison to surrounding mangrove forests (105 m-2). Hydro-leveling resulted in mortality of mangroves adjacent to the mounds being leveled. This was probably caused by burial of pneumatophores during the hydro-leveling process. For hydro-leveling to be a useful and successful restoration technique several requirements must be met. Spoil mounds must be lowered to the level of the surrounding wetlands. Spoil must be distributed further into the adjacent wetland to prevent burial of nearby native vegetation. Finally, native species may need to be planted on hydro-leveled areas to speed up the re-vegetation process. {\{}{\{}{\}}{\{}{\textcopyright}{\}}{\{}{\}}{\}} Springer Science+Business Media B.V. 2007.},

abstract = {Considerable progress has been made in reducing the discharge of atmospheric pollutants from point sources such as effluent pipes. A more difficult challenge involves identifying and controlling environmental contaminants generated by dispersed or nonpoint sources such as automobile exhaust, pesticide applications, and myriad commercial and industrial processes. Nonpoint pollutants can travel far from their sources when they are discharged into rivers or enter the atmosphere. While waterborne contaminantshavereceivedgrowingattention, littlerecognitionhassofarbeengiventothefar-rangingenvironmentalconsequences of toxic substances and nutrients that are transported via the air. This report reviews three categories of airborne pollutants that we consider of greatest concern, both for their ecological effects and their impacts on the health of fish, wildlife, and humans: {\textperiodcentered} Organic compounds: These include long-recognized persistent organic pollutants and a vastly larger group of chemicals such as brominated flame retardants, water-repellent coatings, and synthetic fragrances that remain largely unmonitored andunregulated. {\textperiodcentered} Mercury: Oxidized forms of mercury readily rain from the air onto terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. In sediments, they can be transformed into monomethyl mercury, the form most toxic to fish and the wildlife and humans that consume fish. {\textperiodcentered} Nutrients: Atmospheric transport is a significant and increasing source of plant nutrients to freshwater and marine ecosystems and can accelerate eutrophication of these waters. A review of the available scientific information indicates that: {\textperiodcentered} The pollutants that are most likely to present ecological risks are those that are (1) highly bioaccumulative, building up to high levels in animal tissues even when concentrations in the water remain relatively low, and (2) highly toxic, so that they cause harm at comparatively low doses. {\textperiodcentered} Atmosphere-water interactions that control the input and outgassing of persistent organic pollutants in aquatic systems arecriticallyimportantindeterminingthecyclingandresidencetimesofthesecompoundsandtheextentofcontamination of food webs. {\textperiodcentered} Although the effects of various types of pollutants are usually evaluated independently, many regions are subject to multiple pollutants, and their fate and impacts are intertwined. The effects of nutrient deposition on coastal waters, for instance, can alter how various organic contaminants and mercury are processed and bioaccumulated, and ultimately, how they affect aquatic organisms. {\textperiodcentered} For many organic pollutants, even long-banned chemicals such as PCBs and other organochlorines, non-atmospheric sources have been well controlled while atmospheric sources have either been neglected or ignored. {\textperiodcentered} Ecological effects of airborne organochlorines are a particular concern at high latitudes and altitudes. Even though concentrations of organochlorines in air masses and snow from northern and alpine regions are generally low, the food web dynamics, physiologies, and life cycles of cold region animals allow these contaminants to be biomagnified to extraordinary degrees in food chains. Atmospherically deposited contaminants are generated largely by human activities, and reducing the extent and impacts of this increasingly significant source of environmental pollution will require greater recognition, monitoring, and ultimately, regulation.},

abstract = {The estuaries of Tampa Bay, Sarasota Bay, Lemon Bay, and Upper Charlotte Harbor are contiguous waterbodies located within the subtropical environment of Southwest Florida. Based on an examination of rainfall data over the period of record (1916-2001) within the watersheds of these estuaries, there is no evidence for spatial differences (at the watershed level) or monotonic trends in annual rainfall. During the 1980s, nitrogen loads into Tampa Bay and Sarasota Bay (generated primarily by domestic wastewater treatment facilities) were reduced by 57{\%} and 46{\%}, respectively. In response, both Tampa Bay and Sarasota Bay have lower phytoplankton concentrations, greater water clarity and more extensive seagrass coverage in 2002 than in the early 1980s. As there is no evidence of a concurrent trend in rainfall during the period of 1982-2001, it is unlikely that variation in rainfall can account for the observed increase in seagrass coverage in these two bays. In contrast, seagrass coverage has remained relatively constant since the mid 1980s in Lemon Bay and Charlotte Harbor. Domestic wastewater treatment facilities are minor sources of nitrogen to Lemon Bay, and water clarity in Charlotte Harbor varies mostly as a function of dissolved organic matter and non-chlorophyll associated turbidity, not phytoplankton levels. Even in estuaries that share boundaries and are within 100 km of each other, varied responses to anthropogenic changes and natural phenomena were observed in water quality and associated seagrass extent. Resource management strategies must take into account system-specific factors-not all strategies will result in similar results in different systems. {\textcopyright} 2005 Elsevier Ltd.

abstract = {The abundance of birds recorded in the North American Breeding Bird Survey decreased by tip to 18 percent between 1966 and 2005. The abundance of US and Canadian resident species decreased by 30 percent, and that of migrants within the United States and Canada decreased by 19 percent. By contrast, Neotropical migrants increased by up to 20 percent. Land-cover changes in northern latitudes therefore seem more consequential for bird populations than those occurring in Neotropical habitats. Lower abundances were most marked for resident breeding birds that used open, edge, and wetland habitats, the environments most affected by human disturbances-particularly urban sprawl-in northern latitudes. The abundance of resident and migrant forest-dwelling birds increased (although trends varied from species to species), with the increases seeming to follow the 20th-century expansion of forest area in northern latitudes, rather than the loss of Neotropical forests. The geographic footprint of changes in bird abundance linked to habitat changes in North America may thus be extending southward, with negative effects on birds that use open habitats and positive effects on forest birds.},

abstract = {Increasingly government agencies are seeking to quantify the outcomes of proposed policy options in terms of ecosystem service benefits, yet conflicting definitions and ad hoc approaches to measuring ecosystem services have created confusion regarding how to rigorously link ecological change to changes in human well-being. Here, we describe a step-by-step framework for producing ecological models and metrics that can effectively serve an economic-benefits assessment of a proposed change in policy or management. A focus of the framework is developing comparable units of ecosystem goods and services to support decision-making, even if outcomes cannot be monetized. Because the challenges to translating ecological changes to outcomes appropriate for economic analyses are many, we discuss examples that demonstrate practical methods and approaches to overcoming data limitations. The numerous difficult decisions that government agencies must make to fairly use and allocate natural resources provides ample opportunity for interdisciplinary teams of natural and social scientists to improve methods for quantifying changes in ecosystem services and their effects on human well-being. This framework is offered with the intent of promoting the success of such teams as they support managers in evaluating the equivalency of ecosystem service offsets and trades, establishing restoration and preservation priorities, and more generally, in developing environmental policy that effectively balances multiple perspectives.},

@book{Yates2011,
abstract = {Tampa Bay is recognized internationally for its remarkable progress towards recovery since it was pronounced “dead” in the late 1970s. Due to significant efforts by local governments, industries and private citizens throughout the watershed, water clarity in Tampa Bay is now equal to what it was in 1950, when population in the watershed was less than one-quarter of what it is today. Seagrass extent has increased by more than 8,000 acres since the mid-1980s, and fish and wildlife populations are increasing. Central to this successful turn-around has been the Tampa Bay resource management community's long-term commitment to development and implementation of strong science-based management strategies. Research institutions and agencies, including Eckerd College, the Florida Wildlife Commission Fish and Wildlife Research Institute, Mote Marine Laboratory, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, the Southwest Florida Water Management District, University of South Florida, U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, U.S. Geological Survey, local and State governments, and private companies contribute significantly to the scientific basis of our understanding of Tampa Bay's structure and ecological function. Resource management agencies, including the Tampa Bay Regional Planning Council's Agency on Bay Management, the Southwest Florida Water Management District's Surface Water Improvement and Management Program, and the Tampa Bay Estuary Program, depend upon this scientific basis to develop and implement regional adaptive management programs. The importance of integrating science with management has become fully recognized by scientists and managers throughout the region, State and Nation. Scientific studies conducted in Tampa Bay over the past 10–15 years are increasingly diverse and complex, and resource management programs reflect our increased knowledge of geology, hydrology and hydrodynamics, ecology and restoration techniques. However, a synthesis of this research and its integration into resource management has not been prepared for Tampa Bay since the mid-1980s. The need for an up-to-date synthesis of Tampa Bay science and management has resulted in the production of this document. The U.S. Geological Survey recently completed a 5-year Tampa Bay Integrated Science Study, and the Tampa Bay Estuary Program updated the Comprehensive Conservation and Management Plan for Tampa Bay in 2006. These efforts build upon results of the many research and management studies and programs summarized here.},

abstract = {Abstract Coastal wetlands are considered to be amongst the most productive ecosystems and can provide invaluable ecological services. However, coastal wetlands are listed amongst the most threatened ecosystems suffering from anthropogenic activities. The loss or degradation of coastal wetlands has drawn a high level of attention to wetland restoration. Improvement of the structure and function of degraded, damaged and destroyed wetlands may be achieved through ecological restoration. Large numbers of restoration projects have been conducted worldwide based on different restoration goals and different methods. It is undoubtedly important to evaluate whether coastal wetland restoration is successful. However, coastal wetland restoration assessment has become challenging because of current disagreement on definitions and concepts of restoration evaluation. We reviewed the methodology of coastal wetland restoration and criteria for success evaluation, and then summarized the issues for current wetland restoration and success evaluation based on literature review. Moreover, we used an estuarine wetland affected by urbanization as a sample to demonstrate how to establish a success indicator system for guiding wetland restoration and evaluating the success of wetland restoration.},
